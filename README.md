# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard 

## Description
The goal of this project was to create an application that would let a user easily find weather forecast information on any city. This was accomplished with the use of the 'openweathermap' API and the GET fetch method which allowed me to grab the data values that I wanted. While developing this application, I was able to increase my strength with using server-side APIs.

## Installation
Click this link to view the deployed website: https://farmfreshyeets.github.io/weather-dashboard-ch6/

## Usage
To use this application, enter a city name in the 'City' input field and press the search button to see the forecast. The upper card will display today's weather, and the bottom section will show the forecast for the next 5 days. After reloading the page, you will be able to see your previous searches that you can click on to revisit those search results.
